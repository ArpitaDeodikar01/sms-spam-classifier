# **SMS Spam Classifier**

## **Project Overview**

The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning-based application that can classify text messages (SMS or emails) as either **spam** or **not spam**. The classifier uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the input text and applies a machine learning model to make predictions. It helps in detecting spam messages, which could potentially be used for various applications, such as email filtering or SMS spam detection.

### **How It Works**

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Input text is first preprocessed by transforming it to lowercase, removing punctuations, tokenizing words, removing stopwords, and applying stemming.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The text is then transformed into numerical features using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization.
3. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained using labeled text data to classify whether the text is spam or not.
4. **Prediction**: When a user enters a message, the app preprocesses and vectorizes the message and makes a prediction using the trained model.

## **Libraries Used**

* **Streamlit**: A library for creating web applications in Python. It is used for building the front end of the application, allowing users to input messages and see predictions.
* **pandas**: Used for handling and analyzing data, particularly in reading and processing the dataset.
* **pickle**: A library used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. In this project, pickle is used to save and load the trained model and vectorizer.
* **nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A library for working with human language data (text). It is used for tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming in text preprocessing.
* **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library in Python. It is used for:

  * **TfidfVectorizer**: For transforming the input text into a numeric representation using TF-IDF.
  * **MultinomialNB**: A Naive Bayes classifier used for text classification.
  * **train\_test\_split**: For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## **Models Used**

### **1. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**

The **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It is particularly effective for classification tasks involving discrete features, such as word counts or frequencies.

* **Purpose**: This model is used to classify messages as **spam** (1) or **not spam** (0).
* **Why MultinomialNB?**: It is suitable for text classification tasks where the features are word frequencies, and it performs well when the data is sparse, which is typical for text data.

  The model is trained on a dataset of labeled messages, where each message is labeled as spam or not spam. It uses the features extracted by the **TF-IDF vectorizer** to predict the class of new, unseen messages.

### **2. TF-IDF Vectorizer**

* **Purpose**: The **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorizer is used to convert the text data into numerical features. It calculates the importance of each word in a given message by considering how frequently it appears in the message (Term Frequency) and how unique the word is across all messages (Inverse Document Frequency).
* **Why TF-IDF?**: This method helps to extract the most important words from the text while reducing the weight of common words (like "the", "and", etc.) that are not useful in classification.

## **Dataset**

The model is trained on a **SMS spam dataset** that contains labeled messages. The dataset includes two columns:

* **label**: The classification label (spam or ham)
* **message**: The actual text message

The data is used to train the model, which can then predict whether new messages are spam or not.

#MODELS USED

* `model.pkl`: The trained Naive Bayes model.
* `vectorizer.pkl`: The fitted TF-IDF vectorizer.

### 4. Run the Application:

To start the web application, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will launch in your browser where you can enter messages to classify them as spam or not spam.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to classify text messages as spam or not spam. The model leverages **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for classification and **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction. It can be deployed as a web application using **Streamlit**, making it accessible for real-time predictions.
